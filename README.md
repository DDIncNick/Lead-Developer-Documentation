# Lead Developer Documentation

###### The purpose of this documentation website is to help Designing Digitally in the transition of my leave from the company. I have been the Lead Developer for 3 years and in turn, I have consistently changed how I work and what I use. This document will contain all the information about my current workflow and what I use.

## Programming Paradigm <a name="Programming"></a>

**_I will briefly explain the programming paradigms[^1] I follow_**.

**_I will not be explaining the differences between these two models that I use, but I will link resources for you to read as both paradigms are not something that can be summarized and still make sense._**

I typically follow an [Object-Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) methodology. Meaning a majority of the time my code uses reusable objects. This method is generally used for full-scale projects. 

Whereas with [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) it is a polar opposite, code is not reusable- nor is the data used in functional programming muatble. I will use functional programming for quick turn-around demos, or small projects with tight deadlines.

> _There is no right or wrong paradigm to follow. I will create a table below that lists some of the pros/cons between the two._

| Object-Oriented Programming | Pros | Cons |  Functional Programming | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |  --- | --- | --- |
| Allows Parallel Developement | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |  Logical | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| Modular Classes which are reusable | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |  Debugging is easier | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| Coding base is easier to maintain and document | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | Lazy evaluation | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| It can be inefficient | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: | Combining pure functions | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| It can be too scalable | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: | Recursion | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| It can cause duplication | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: | Mathematical terminology | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: |

[^1]: I only reference two Paradigms for programming. There are several and there are 4 major programming paradigms that are usually followed. So far in my career in web you mostly see functional and OOP which is why I only mention these two.

## Resources <a name="Resources"></a>

###### List of resources I find valuable that I have used in my process of learning.

### Coding Train
Coding Train is a website built by Programmer and Professor [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/Shiffman) 

He teaches several different subjects related to programming. But his [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) channel offers some incredible tutorials ranging from absolute beginner-level introductions to building out functional projects. 

### Devlin Peck
Devlin Peck is a popular Articulate Storyline developer, he has a [website](https://www.devlinpeck.com/tutorials) with several useful tutorials.

### Git SCM
Git SCM is a command-line Source Code Management tool. I will go into more detail in the [Github README](./Github/Github-README.md) file. But I will list resources here I found useful for learning Git SCM.

1. [Git SCM Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs)
2. [Official Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
3. [Everyday Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday)
4. [Git Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com/)
5. [Backlog Git Tutorial](https://backlog.com/git-tutorial/)
