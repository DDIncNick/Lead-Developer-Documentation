# Lead Developer Documentation

###### The purpose of this documentation website is to help Designing Digitally in the transition of my leave from the company. I have been the Lead Developer for 3 years and in turn, I have consistently changed how I work and what I use. This document will contain all the information about my current workflow and what I use.
